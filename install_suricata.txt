We will start by downloading the suricata msi from their official website: https://suricata.io/download/ - https://www.openinfosecfoundation.org/download/windows/Suricata-7.0.10-1-64bit.msi

We also need to install npcap if not already installed: https://npcap.com/#download
https://npcap.com/dist/npcap-1.81.exe

we then copy from C:\Windows\System32\Npcap:
1.	Wpcap.dll
2.	Packet.dll
To C:\Program Files\Suricata

Now we are going to add the rules we want to invoke:
e.g: https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata-7.0/emerging.rules.zip

we will copy the rules inside to the C:\Program Files\Suricata\rules folder.
